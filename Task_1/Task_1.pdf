## Make.com Scenario Steps

### 1. Schedule the Automation
- **Module**: Scheduler
- **Configuration**:
  - Set to run daily at 7:00 AM in the desired timezone.
  - Use the "Daily" schedule option in Make.com.

### 2. Retrieve Data from Airtable
- **Module**: Airtable > Search Records
- **Configuration**:
  - Connect to the Airtable base containing the contact data.
  - Table: Select the table (e.g., "Contacts").
  - Fields: Select `Name`, `Email`, `Company Name`.
  - Output: All records (no filter needed unless you want to limit the data).

### 3. Generate Company Summaries (Simulated ChatGPT)
- **Module**: HTTP > Make an API Request (to simulate ChatGPT via an API like OpenAIâ€™s)
- **Configuration**:
  - **URL**: `https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions` (or equivalent ChatGPT API endpoint).
  - **Method**: POST
  - **Headers**:
    - Authorization: `Bearer {{your_openai_api_key}}`
    - Content-Type: `application/json`
  - **Body**:
    ```json
    {
      "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
      "messages": [
        {
          "role": "user",
          "content": "Generate a brief summary (50-100 words) of the company {{Company Name}}."
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
  - **Loop**: Iterate over each Airtable record to generate a summary for each `Company Name`.
  - **Simulated Summaries** (since I canâ€™t call ChatGPT directly):
    - **Outreachify**: A digital marketing firm specializing in personalized email outreach campaigns to boost client engagement.
    - **Techspire**: An innovative tech startup focused on AI-driven solutions for enterprise automation and efficiency.
    - **FinOptics**: A fintech company offering advanced analytics for optimizing financial portfolios and risk management.
    - **Cloudvertise**: A cloud-based advertising platform that leverages data analytics for targeted marketing.
    - **MediaLogic**: A media consultancy providing strategic solutions for content creation and distribution.
    - **BluePeak AI**: A leader in AI research, developing cutting-edge algorithms for predictive analytics.

### 4. Create a Google Doc
- **Module**: Google Docs > Create a Document
- **Configuration**:
  - Document Name: `Daily Company Summary Report - {{current_date}}`
  - Content:
    ```markdown
    # Daily Company Summary Report
    {{current_date}}

    {{for each company in Airtable records}}
    ## {{Company Name}}
    {{Simulated ChatGPT Summary}}
    {{end loop}}
    ```
  - Example Output Content:
    ```markdown

    ```

### 5. Send Report to Slack
- **Module**: Slack > Send a Message
- **Configuration**:
  - Connect to the Slack workspace and select the target channel (e.g., `#reports`).
  - Message:
    ```markdown
    ðŸ“Š *Daily Company Summary Report* - {{current_date}}
    The report has been generated and is available in Google Docs: {{Google Doc URL}}
    ```
  - Attach the Google Doc URL from the previous moduleâ€™s output.

## Notes
- **API Key**: Ensure you have an OpenAI API key for ChatGPT integration. Store it securely in Make.comâ€™s connection settings.
- **Error Handling**: Add an error handler module to notify you (e.g., via Slack or email) if the API call or Google Doc creation fails.
- **Timezone**: Verify the schedulerâ€™s timezone matches your requirement for 7:00 AM.
- **Airtable Schema**: Ensure the Airtable table has columns `Name`, `Email`, and `Company Name` exactly as specified.
- **Permissions**: Grant Make.com access to Airtable, Google Docs, and Slack via their respective APIs.

## Expected Output
- Every day at 7:00 AM, a Google Doc is created with the company names and their summaries.
- A Slack message is sent to the specified channel with a link to the Google Doc.
